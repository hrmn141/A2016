    <h2>Economic and Policy Changes</h2>
    <p>
      The year 2016 marked a period of significant policy driven change in India.
      Government initiatives focused on formalising the economy, increasing
      transparency, and strengthening financial systems.
    </p>

    <h2>Demonetisation</h2>
    <p>
      In November 2016, the withdrawal of high value currency notes became one of
      the most impactful economic decisions in recent history. The move aimed to
      reduce black money, counterfeit currency, and promote banking habits.
    </p>

    <p>
      While the decision caused short term disruption, it also accelerated public
      awareness of digital transactions and formal financial channels.
    </p>

    <h2>Rise of Digital Payments</h2>
    <p>
      As cash circulation reduced, digital payment platforms saw rapid adoption.
      Mobile wallets, online banking, and card based payments expanded beyond
      urban centres into smaller towns and semi urban regions.
    </p>

    <h2>Growth of Social Media and Internet Access</h2>
    <p>
      2016 witnessed a sharp increase in internet usage across India. Affordable
      data plans and smartphones brought millions of new users online, reshaping
      communication, entertainment, and information sharing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Social media platforms became central to news consumption, public discussion,
      and political messaging, influencing opinions and trends nationwide.
    </p>

    <h2>Technology and Startup Culture</h2>
    <p>
      India’s technology ecosystem continued to expand in 2016. Startups focused
      on e commerce, digital services, and app based solutions attracted investment
      and reshaped consumer behaviour.
    </p>

    <h2>Public Response and Daily Life</h2>
    <p>
      Ordinary citizens experienced noticeable changes in daily routines, from
      how payments were made to how information was accessed. The year highlighted
      India’s transition toward a more digitally connected society.
    </p>
